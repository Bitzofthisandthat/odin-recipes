# odin-recipes

This is the Recipes Project I created while following Foundation course provided by The Odin Projects. 

Within this Recipe Project I will utilize and/or display some basic coding and HTML skills I have recently learned including, but not limited to: creating HTML files, headers, bodies, paragraphs, Headings (1-6), Images, Links, bold, italisized, lists (ordered and unordered), and everything in between. 

This is the first project I will be taking part in during the Foundations course and I am super excited to give it a go!
