    <p>It’s creamy, lemony, herby, nutty and just damn right delicious. Plus it comes together in 30 minutes!</p>
   
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  
    <ul>
        <li>New potatoes – you can use any, jersey royal or British gems are my favourite</li>
        <li>Basil</li>
        <li>Pine nuts</li>
        <li>Nutritional yeast or vegan parmesan</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Vegan Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> First start my boiling the potatoes in salted water. You want to make sure you cut the potatoes in similar sizes so they cook evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Whilst the potatoes are cooking, prepare the pesto. Place the basil, pine nuts, nutritional yeast, lemon, garlic and salt in a food processor. Blend until the pine nuts have broken down and all the basil is finely chopped.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong> Whilst still blending, gently drizzle the olive oil until all combined and smooth. Taste and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong> Once the potatoes are cooked, drain and then run under cold water to cool them down. Place in a bowl and add the pesto, mayonnaise, lemon zest and toasted pine nuts.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong> Carefully mix using a large spoon or gently toss the bowl until all combined. Top with some extra chopped basil and black pepper and serve!</li>
    </ol>
