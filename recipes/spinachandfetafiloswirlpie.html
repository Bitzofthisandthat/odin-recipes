    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

        <li>125g unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>½ tbsp sesame seeds</li>

            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>Glug olive oil</li>

            <li>150g goat’s cheese, crumbled (we used Capricorn with the rind)</li>
            <li>40g pecorino, grated (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
            <li>3 medium free-range eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>Bunch fresh dill, chopped, plus extra to serve</li>
            <li>Small bunch fresh flatleaf parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried mint</li>
            <li>Pinch chilli flakes</li>
            <li>Finely grated zest and juice 1 lemon</li>
            <li>75g toasted pine nuts (optional)</li>
            <li>Nutmeg for grating</li>
            <li>Greek yogurt and mixed olives to serve</li>
        <li>Baking sheet lined with baking paper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> For the filling, gently fry both types of onion in a pan with a glug of olive oil and seasoning for 6-8 minutes until starting to soften. Set aside in a large mixing bowl while you prepare the spinach.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Wilt the spinach in batches in your largest pan with a tiny splash of water (or in their bags in the microwave, if you prefer). Drain, cool, then squeeze out any excess water in a colander using a wooden spoon. Put in a clean tea towel or muslin square and squeeze tightly to remove any remaining water. Roughly chop and put in the bowl with the onions.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong> Add all the cheeses, the eggs, fresh and dried herbs, chilli flakes, lemon juice, pine nuts (if using), a good grating of nutmeg, a little salt and plenty of black pepper, then mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong> Heat the oven to 190°C/170°C fan/gas 5. Put 1 rectangular sheet of filo on a work surface, brush all over with melted butter, then top with another sheet of filo, brushing as before. Add a third of the spinach mixture in a line along one long edge, then roll up into a cylinder, brushing the filo with butter as you roll (see tip).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong> Starting from one end, wind the filo into a coil and put on the baking sheet. Repeat twice more in the same way, coiling each filo cylinder around the previous one to make a larger spiral. Brush the finished pie all over with melted butter (or use olive oil if you’ve run out), then sprinkle with the seeds. Bake for 50-60 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong> Serve scattered with lemon zest and chopped dill, with bowls of yogurt and olives alongside.</li>
    </ol>
