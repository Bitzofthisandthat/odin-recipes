    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter (or ghee)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 head cauliflower, cut into florets</li>
        <li>1 pound (500 g) mushrooms, cleaned</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons low sodium vegetable stock</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To make the sauteed cauliflower and mushrooms skillet: Heat the butter and oil in a large pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté the onion until softened (about 3 minutes).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the mushrooms and cook for about 4-5 minutes on all sides. Make sure the mushrooms render as much moisture as possible. Brown them a little more if necessary, to avoid the side dish becoming soggy at the end. Keep an eye on it so they don’t burn either ;)</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong> Once mushrooms are well browned, add cauliflower florets. Cook until golden and crispy on the edges, about 8-10 minutes. Veggies must be well browned.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong> Pour in the vegetable stock and cook for 2 minutes, to reduce the sauce slightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong> Add thyme, 1 tablespoon of parsley, and garlic. Cook the mushrooms and cauliflower for half a minute, until fragrant. Season generously with salt and pepper, to taste, sprinkle with remaining parsley, and serve the garlic butter mushrooms and cauliflower skillet immediately. Enjoy!</li>
